üîß Environment Setup & Deployment
1. **Local Environment Setup**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
     ```
     SERVICE_API_KEY=your_service_api_key
     CREW_AI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     CREW_AI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
     ```

2. **Firebase Deployment**
   - Navigate to the `firebase` directory
   - Copy `firebase.json.template` to `firebase.json` and add your actual API keys:
     ```
     {
       "functions": {
         "source": "functions",
         "codebase": "default",
         "ignore": [
           "node_modules",
           ".git",
           "firebase-debug.log",
           "firebase-debug.*.log"
         ],
         "predeploy": [
           "npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" run lint",
           "npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" run build"
         ],
         "gen": 2,
         "environmentVariables": {
           "SERVICE_API_KEY": "your_service_api_key",
           "CREW_AI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key",
           "CREW_AI_BASE_URL": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Build and deploy: `npm --prefix functions run build && firebase deploy --only functions`
   - Access your API at the provided URL with the header `X-API-Key: your_service_api_key`

3. **Security Note**
   - Both `.env` and `firebase.json` contain sensitive API keys
   - These files are added to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive information
   - Always use the template files for version control and add actual keys only in your local environment
